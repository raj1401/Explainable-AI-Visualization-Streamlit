This dashboard is an autonomic machine learning platform that is used to train machine-learning
platforms on tabular time-series data. The platform has the following functionalities:
Data Preprocessing - The user can perform detect and remove null values, inconsistencies, duplicates,
outliers, scale the data, impute the data to make it periodic, and label encode non-numeric data.
Model Training - The user can select one of regression models (Random Forest regressor, Linear Regression,
KNN regressor, SVM regressor) or classification models (Random Forest classifier, Logistic Regression,
KNN classifier, SVM classifier) depending on the type of target variable (whether it is continuous
or discrete). The platform performs a five-fold cross validation to tune the hyperparameters, which the
user has an option to change. A final model is trained based on the final hyperparameters.
Feature Selection - Importance of various features of the data can be computed using SHAP, Recursive
Feature Elimination, or Boruta Algorithm (only for Random Forest models).
Model Performance - The performance of the final model (trained either on all features or selected features)
can be visualized as various graphs and metrics.
Forecasting - The platform allows for univariate time-series forecasting using an LSTM RNN, whose
hyperparameters can be set by the user.
